Underwater Communication using OFDM techniques

Designing an underwater communication for modulation and demodulation of acoustic waves using OFDM technique. We are simulating it using MATLAB and Simulink. The channels considered for transmission are
###### Marine water
###### River water
###### Deep underwater
###### Shallow underwater
